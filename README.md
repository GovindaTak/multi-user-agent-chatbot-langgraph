# multi-user-agent-chatbot-langgraph
A hands-on project that demonstrates building an AI-powered agentic chatbot from scratch using LangGraph. The chatbot evolves in three phases:  A simple agent with LangGraph.  An enhanced agent with tool integration (Web Search + Weather API).  A multi-user chatbot with session-based memory for contextual continuity.
